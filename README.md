- Data modeling
- Analytical queries

## Key Questions Answered

- Do test preparation courses improve results?
- Are there performance differences based on parental education?

## Key Insights
- Students who completed test prep scored on average X% higher.
- Math scores correlate more strongly with study time than reading scores.

## What I Learned
- Writing complex SQL joins
- Aggregations and grouping
- Translating real-world questions into SQL queries
